# Simple Chess Game

## Overview

This project is a simple, browser-based chess game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a basic chessboard interface where a human player can play against a computer opponent with limited intelligence.

## Features

- Interactive chessboard with clickable pieces
- Basic piece movement for the human player (white pieces)
- Simple computer opponent (black pieces) that makes random legal pawn moves
- Animated piece movements
- Single HTML file containing all game logic and styling

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the HTML file.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
3. The game will start automatically. You play as white, and the computer plays as black.
4. Click on a piece to select it, then click on a valid square to move the piece.
5. After your move, the computer will automatically make its move.

## Project Structure

The entire game is contained within a single HTML file:

- HTML structure for the chessboard
- CSS for styling the board and pieces
- JavaScript for game logic and interactivity

## Limitations

- Only basic pawn moves are implemented for the computer player
- Other chess pieces do not have movement rules implemented
- No implementation of check, checkmate, or game-ending conditions
- Special moves like castling and en passant are not available
- The computer's "intelligence" is very limited, making random legal pawn moves

## Potential Improvements

1. Implement movement rules for all chess pieces
2. Add logic for check and checkmate
3. Implement special moves (castling, en passant, pawn promotion)
4. Enhance the computer player's intelligence
5. Add a game menu, move history, and captured pieces display
6. Implement multiplayer functionality
7. Add unit tests for game logic
8. Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into different files for better organization
